# The Statistical Office

[zh.ch/statistisches-amt]()

The Statistical Office provides the population, companies, politicians, the public administration and organisations with __statistics, data and analyses on the Canton of Zurich__. 

Additionally it carries out a role related to political rights. It operates the __cantonal election and voting center__ during ballots. Municipalities count the incoming votes and submit their results to the Statistical Office, which asseses and verifies vote and election results. The Office submits the verified results to the federal level and publishes them.

???
Unlike in many other cantons, where this is often a task of the state chancellery.

→ Since the beginning of 2020 we use a R-Shiny based Tool, named __PlausiApp__, for this purpose.

--

→ We use R in the production of our statistics and data products as well as at the heart of the direct democratic process!


???
Why R : We make extensive use of R in the production of our statistics and data products - it is our 'main' data / statistics-programming language. But with the Plausi App we use R at the heart of the democratic process.

# The PlausiApp

# The PlausiApp

The PlausiApp aims at identifying anomalies in the results on vote sundays. It allows to assess and verify vote results systematically.

### Aims

- Detect routine errors automatically at an early stage
- Increase the quality of result submission and preventing the publication of erroneous results
- Reduce the workload caused by former ad hoc-verification
- Build confidence in the electoral process

# Outlier Detection

Do the reported values lie in the expected range?

__In relation to the past:__

- Channels of submission (mail / polling booths)
- Number of eligible voters

__In relation to other municipalities:__

- Ranking of the Participation (%) of <br>the various vote issues
- Share of ballots which are:
  - empty
  - invalid (with no clear vote intention)
  - contained in envelopes without transmission card
  

???
Channels of submission - we check if the share of the votes submited by the differents channels (votes submitted by mail / votes submitted in person at the polling booth) lie within the expected range for each municipality given the past. The shares of the channels vary a bit according to the municipality type (bigger cities / smaller municipalities).

Participation : there's always a ranking - heuristically speaking federal vote topics do usually have slightly higher participation than cantonal ones and certain topics do 'mobilize' slightly more. There usually is a very clear common pattern across municipalities.

We use the Median absolute deviation as a measure (robust / ideal for small sample size). We've tried out several measures (z-scores, tukeys fences) and even some multivariate approaches (isolation forests). But for our purposes the univariate MAD-approach works best when it comes to detect outliers, both when it comes to detection of errors as well as when it comes to interpretability (its easy to explain / interpret).

# Prediction of Approval Patterns

Once a handful of municipalities have completed the count, a prediction of the final results (% of Yes Votes) for all areas can be made. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(plausi)

predict_votes(votes=c("Eidg1","Kant1"), 
              train=votedata, 
              exclude_votes=TRUE)
```
→ All the via [caret package](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) available algorithms can be used.

**Comparison : Prediction VS Actual Result**

→ Deviations between the actual and the predicted yes share may indicate errors.

# Caveats

> The PlausiApp has brought a significant gain in efficiency and allows to detect potentially damaging errors in a highly reliable way, but there are some caveats.


- Good detection of potentially damaging errors for smaller municipalities

- Our checks signal even small deviations, but smaller relative errors might still sometimes go undetected

- Problematic in the case of large counting districts, where small relative errors can be significant in absolute terms

> The PlausiApp has brought a significant gain in efficiency and allows to detect potentially damaging errors in a highly reliable way, but there are some caveats.


- Good detection of potentially damaging errors for smaller municipalities, where errors of higher magnitude are the potentially damaging ones

- Even if many checks signal even small deviations, smaller relative errors might sometimes go undetected.

- In the case of large counting districts (Cities), small relative errors potentially are still significant in absolute terms. The risk is mitigated by the high degree of professionalisation of quality control in larger counting districts.

# Re-use by other Cantons
open source makes it possible!

# Re-use by other Cantons

As the PlausiApp is based on the __Open Source__ Programming Language R, __its code can be freely shared__ with other Cantons.

The project is hosted on gitlab  (Access upon request):

`r fontawesome::fa("gitlab", height="1em")` [plausi/plausiapp](https://gitlab.com/plausi/plausiapp)

We already cooperate with two other Cantons, which have started using the PlausiApp this year:

- St. Gallen 
- Thurgau

By learning from their experiences, we strive to improve the App and make its re-use easier.

# Outlook

# Outlook

- __Continuous minor improvements__

- __Making Re-Use of the PlausiApp easier__ 

   Cooperation with SG & TG to empower them to use the App ongoing

- __Common standard for result verification data exports__ 

  Coordinative efforts to define a common standard (eCH) for result verification data exports, in order that the tool could be used by any canton easily and irrespective of the result software in use.

- __Preparations for the elections 2023__

  Preparation of a verification logic suited for the elections 2023 (cantonal / national)
